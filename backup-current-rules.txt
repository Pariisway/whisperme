// If you see anything other than what's below, they're blocking access:

// WRONG (blocks everything):
// allow read, write: if false;

// allow read, write: if request.auth.uid != null;

// CORRECT (for development):
// allow read, write: if request.auth != null;

// MOST OPEN (temporary testing):
// allow read, write: if true;
